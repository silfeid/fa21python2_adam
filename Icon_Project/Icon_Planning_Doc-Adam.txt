FUNCTIONS


read_in_icon()
        Opens csv
        Creates dict from csv rows
                Keys are 1-10
                Values are lists of 0’s, 1’s


print_icon()
        Read key/values pairs
        Print lists (values) as graphic/icon
        Transform 0’s to spaces, 1’s to symbol (@, #, etc.)
        New line after each row


transform_icon()
        Scaling is probably easiest - double each 0, 1, in each row and then duplicate the   doubled rows.
        Rotate 90/180 seems a lot harder
        Invert Colors seems pretty easy
        Mirroring is probably doable
